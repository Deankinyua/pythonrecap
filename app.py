One of the key features of Python is that everything is an object, and the type is just one attribute of an object. As an illustration, we can assign a single integer to a variable, and use the Python built-in function dir for
finding out the attributes of the object. If you execute the following twolines in an interactive interpreter, it should become clear that a Pythoninteger is much more complex than just a number. Please feel free toexperiment also with other types!
